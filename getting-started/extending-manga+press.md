# Extending Manga+Press

Manga+Press comes with several theme-extendable templates that can be used to customize Manga+Press' output. These templates are: `single-comic.php`, `latest-comic.php`, `comic-archive-list.php`, `comic-archive-gallery.php`, `comic-archive-calendar.php`, `opengraph-tags.php`, and `twittercards.php`. With the exception of single-comic.php, these templates need to placed inside the `comics` sub-directory of your child-theme.

Theme Customization goes over how to customize your theme to use with Manga+Press by way of a child-theme.
